    "- How to structure my project?\n",
    "    - A single file?\n",
    "    - Multiple files?\n",
    "    - Multiple directories?\n",
    "\n",
    "- How to manage dependencies?\n",
    "- How to make my code available to others?\n",
    "\n",
    "<p style=\"text-align:right;\"><small>Spoiler: Use packages! üì¶</small></p>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why do I need a üì¶?\n",
    "- Efficient way to structure your code\n",
    "- Easier to create code that can be easily imported and used anywhere in your system\n",
    "- Packages can be easily shared and installed using `pip`\n",
    "- Support for automatic dependency management\n",
    "- Good fit for geospatial projects\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a üì¶?\n",
    "- A üì¶ is basically a collection of modules and subpackages\n",
    "\n",
    "General structure:\n",
    "```\n",
    "‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄmypackage/                  # Top-level package\n",
    "    ‚îÇ  __init__.py              # Initialize the package\n",
    "    ‚îÇ  mymodule.py              # Module\n",
    "    ‚îÇ  mymodule2.py             # Module \n",
    "    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄmysubpackage/       # Subpackage\n",
    "    ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ  __init__.py      # Initialize the subpackage\n",
    "    ‚îÇ       ‚îÇ  mysubmodule.py   # Module\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to use a üì¶?\n",
    "- To use a üì¶, you need to import it!\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the previous example, you could import a module from the package like this:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from mypackage import mymodule\n",
    "# Call a function from the module\n",
    "mymodule.my_function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "To import a module from a subpackage:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from mypackage.mysubpackage import mysubmodule\n",
    "# Call a function from the module\n",
    "mysubmodule.my_function()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## How can a üì¶ help me?\n",
    "> Imagine if you have to read a set of satellite images from a directory (you must support multiple file formats), preprocess the data (different preprocessing algorithm must be provided), and offer tools to visualize and export the data...\n",
    "\n",
    "> You could write a single python file that does all of this, but it would be a mess. Instead, you could create a package that contains a module or subpackage for each of these task categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Example\n",
    "```\n",
    "‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄmygeopackage/               \n",

    "## Packaging Python projects\n",
    "- So far you learned the core structure of a package, but to \"package\" a project you also need some configuration files\n",
    "- Once you have the required files, you can install your package using `pip` \n",
    "- `pip` is the package installer for Python. It can install packages from PyPI (Python Package Index) or other sources\n",
    "\n",
    "## Python project example\n",
    "- In the link below, you can find an example of a geospatial project structured as a package\n",
    "\n",
    "[Example project (Click to view)](https://github.com/lbferreira/geospatial_project_example/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#project-structure)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Installing a üì¶ using `pip`\n",
    "- Once installed, you can import the package from anywhere in your system\n",
    "- To install, inside the project directory, run:\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install .\n",
    "```\n",
    "- To install in editable mode (changes in the code will be reflected in the installed package), run the command below. This is ideal for development.\n",
    "```\n",
    "pip install -e .\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## How to publish a üì¶\n",
    "- ~~To share a package, you can use USPS, FedEx, UPS...~~\n",
    "- You can use PyPI (Python Package Index), conda-forge, or just install the package directly from GitHub.\n",
    "- PyPI and conda-forge are great for general distribution of your package, while GitHub is good for sharing with a specific audience (e.g., a package for internal use of GCER members).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical example\n",
    "Let's download this [github repository](https://github.com/lbferreira/geospatial_project_example/tree/main), and...\n",
    "\n",
    "- Remove current modules/subpackages and create a single module with an example function\n",
    "- Adjust `pyproject.toml`\n",
    "- Create a new conda environment\n",
    "- Intall the package using `pip`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical example\n",
    "Example module with a function that plots random data\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Inside a module called my_module.py\n",
    "import numpy as np\n",
    "import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n",
    "\n",
    "def plot_random_data():\n",
    "    x = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])\n",
    "    y = x**2\n",
    "    plt.plot(x, y)\n",
    "    plt.show()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical example\n",
    "- Create a notebook inside the notebook folder and try to use the function previously created.\n",
    "- It's not possible without installing the package first!\n",
    "- Create and activate a new conda env:\n",
    "```\n",
    "conda create --name gcer_training python=3.10\n",
    "conda activate gcer_training\n",
    "```\n",
    "- Intall the package using `pip`:\n",
    "    - pip install .\n",
    "    - pip install -e .\n",
    "\n",
    "## Managing conda dependencies\n",
    "- Some dependencies need to be installed using conda\n",
    "- Rasterio is typically easier to install using conda (Windows)\n",
    "- The easiest way to handle it is requesting the user to install conda dependencies manually before installing the main package: `conda install -c conda-forge rasterio`\n",
    "- An `environment.yml` file can be used to create a conda environment with all dependencies and also to install the package using `pip`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Managing conda dependencies\n",
    "- What is the `environment.yml` file?\n",
    "- Check [example](https://github.com/lbferreira/geospatial_project_example/blob/main/environment.yml)\n",
    "- Creating a conda env using the `environment.yml` file: `conda env create -f environment.yml`\n",
    "\n",
    "## Intalling the üì¶ from GitHub\n",
    "- To install the package directly from GitHub, use something like:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install git+https://github.com/user_name/repo_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "pip install git+https://github.com/lbferreira/geospatial_project_example\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## Publishing the package to PyPI\n",
    "- Publishing to PyPI is generally simple if you have the package structure and configuration files properly prepared\n",
    "- Tutorial [here](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/#generating-distribution-archives)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Package structure in GitHub repositories\n",
    "Getting familiar with the package structure is useful to understand other packages on GitHub. Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [segment-geospatial](https://github.com/opengeos/segment-geospatial/tree/main)\n",
    "- [Xee](https://github.com/google/Xee)\n",
    "- [geopandas](https://github.com/geopandas/geopandas/tree/main)\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that we learned the core structure of a package/repository. Other files/variations depends on the project requirements and complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints for organizing your code inside the package\n",
    "- A well organized code makes your package easier to understand and maintain\n",
    "- Use meaningful names for your modules, functions, and variables\n",
    "- Create functions and classes with a single responsibility / Avoid large functions/classes\n",
    "- Use type hints and docstrings\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hints for organizing your code inside the package\n",
    "- Do not place specific configurations inside the package, this should be handled by the user who is calling the functions and classes\n",
    "- When performing scientific experiments, you can use notebooks or scripts outside the package\n",
    "\n",
    "## Geospatial project example\n",
    "- Let's analyze an example of a code initially organized in a single file and then refactored into a package\n",
    "- [Example here](https://github.com/lbferreira/geospatial_project_example)"
